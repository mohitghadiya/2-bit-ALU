The 2-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a digital circuit capable of performing basic arithmetic and logical operations on 2-bit inputs. This project implements the following operations:
--Full Addition
--Full Subtraction
--Comparison
--Bitwise AND
--Bitwise OR
--Bitwise XOR

* Features:-

--Takes two 2-bit binary inputs
--Supports multiple arithmetic and logical operations
--Designed using logic gates
--Can be implemented in hardware or simulated in software
